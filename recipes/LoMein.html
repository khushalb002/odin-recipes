            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) package uncooked linguine pasta</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>½ pound fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced</li>
            <li>6 green onions, sliced diagonally into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>In a medium, non-reactive bowl, combine the chicken with 2 1/2 teaspoons of white sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons vinegar and 1/4 cup soy sauce.</p>
                <p>Mix this together and coat the chicken well. Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>In another medium bowl, combine the chicken broth, water, sesame oil and ground black pepper with the remaining sugar, vinegar and soy sauce.</p>
                <p>In a separate small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch with some of this mixture and slowly add to the bulk of the mixture, stirring well. Set aside.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Cook the linguine according to package directions, drain and set aside.</p>
                <p>Heat 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil in a wok or large saucepan over high heat until it starts to smoke.</p>
                <p>Add the chicken and stir-fry for 4 to 5 minutes, or until browned. Transfer this and all juices to a warm plate.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Heat the remaining vegetable oil in the wok or pan over high heat. Add the ginger, garlic, mushrooms and green onions, and stir-fry for 30 seconds.</p>
                <p>Add the reserved sauce mixture and then the chicken. Simmer until the sauce begins to thicken, about 2 minutes.</p>
                <p>Add the reserved noodles and toss gently, coating everything well with the sauce.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
